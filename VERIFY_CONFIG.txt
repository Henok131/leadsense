Run these commands on your server to verify the configuration was saved correctly:

```bash
# Check what's in the actual file
sudo cat /etc/nginx/sites-available/lead.asenaytech.com

# Check if symlink exists
sudo ls -la /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ | grep lead

# Verify NGINX actually reloaded with the new config
sudo nginx -T 2>&1 | grep -A 20 "lead.asenaytech.com"
```

The problem is likely that when you typed "lead" as the filename in nano, it saved to the wrong file. You need to save it as `/etc/nginx/sites-available/lead.asenaytech.com`
